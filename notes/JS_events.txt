The addEventListener() method can also be called without a node, in which case it is applied to the global object,
	usually the whole browser window.
The target property returns a reference to the node that fired the event.

function doSomething(event){
	console.log(event.target);
	console.log(event.type);
}

If you click on one of the<li>elements, youâ€™re also clicking on the<ul>,<body>and<html>elements.
	Either bubbles up by default
	or capture from the top down by
		ulElement.addEventListener('click', function, true);
You can add the event listener to a parent, and target will be the child that was clicked
