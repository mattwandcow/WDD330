"This is better because all the JavaScript is in one place, between the two script tags, instead of mixed with the HTML tags."
"There's no need to actually use a semicolon to terminate a statement because JavaScript interpreters use a process called Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI). This will attempt to place semicolons at the end of lines for you. However, it can be error-prone and cause a number of automated services such as code minifiers and validators to not work properly."
The toFixed() method rounds a number to a fixed number of decimal places: PI.toFixed(3);
The best way to change a string to a number is to use the Number method. This will convert the string form of a number into an actual number: Number('23');
Only 9 values are always false and these are known as falsy values:
	* "" // double quoted empty string literal
	* '' // single quoted empty string literal
	* `` // empty template literal
	* 0
	* -0 // considered different to 0 by JavaScript!
	* NaN
	* false
	* null
	* undefined

Exponents are a**b, a^b is bitwise XOR
	
=== returns true if and only if values are of the same data type and value.
