System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.
    Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.
    User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.
Srict Mode does more warnings and exceptions, for better coding
    'use strict';
        is in scope
alert() stops the code until okay is clicked
Tests
    This is the first practical testing instruction I've ever seen, which is neat
    Jest is testing framework
    test('square root of 4 is 2', () => { expect(squareRoot(4)).toBe(2); });
    enter folder with the file squareroot.test.js and enter jest -c {}
    tests normally kept in seperate file from functions?
    expect(factorsOf('twelve').toThrow();
        tests for exceptions to bad data
