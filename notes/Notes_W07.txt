Chapter 11: Further Functions
    Functions can be passed like any object
    All functions have a .length that returns the number of parameters
    call method
        functionName.call(value)
        runs functionName() with 'this' set to value
    function.apply(this_vallue, [array])
        kinda looks like map, but in reverse
    .cache
        functions can store a value, allows them to do repeat evaluations with just a lookup. 
An Immediately Invoked Function Expression – or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s defined. 
    Add () at end of function declaration
    rewriting functions
        You can reassign a value to a function, even from within the called function.
function party(){
   console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
   party = function(){
       console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');
   }
}
Useful if a function has a bunch of complicated branches needed for version support or other conditions, but is consistently run once dealing with those branches. Replace the branches with the singular twig you need

Generators use the ‘Yeild’ Keyword, which keep values in function’s memory
Functional Programming
    Rules
        1. Only take values from arguments, not globals/states
        2. Doesn’t change anything outside of arguments/returns
        3. The same arguments yield the same results
    Each function needs at least one argument, and must return some value
Currying
    A system where a wrapper function takes an argument, then calls a second function that uses some established value and the wrapper arguments, as a value

	
Sitepoint Chapter 13 Ajax
Ajax: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML:
Fetch API
    fetch(‘URL’).then({do stuff}).catch({on fail})
    fetch(URL).then(response=>{
        response.text() //gets the response as a string
        response.blob()// gets binary object
        response.json()// gets the response as json
    }).catch()
